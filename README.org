* Reading text-based tabular data into Common Lisp

This is a library for reading text-based tabular data (such as CSV) into Common Lisp, using the [[https://github.com/tpapp/cl-data-frame][cl-data-frame]] library.

Documentation is currently incomplete, you should look at the unit tests.

#+begin_src lisp

  (defparameter *d* (data-omnivore:csv-to-data-frame
                     (format nil "Gender,Age,Height~@
                                  \"Male\",30,180.~@
                                  \"Male\",31,182.7~@
                                  \"Female\",32,1.65e2")))

  (cl-slice:slice *d* t :gender)
      ; => #("Male" "Male" "Female")

  (let ((strings (cl-slice:slice *d* t :gender)))
    (eq (aref strings 0) (aref strings 1)))
      ; => T, strings in the same column are interned once

  (cl-slice:slice (data-omnivore:csv-to-data-frame
                   (format nil "\"All kinds of wacky number formats\"~@
                                .7~@
                                19.

                  t :all-kinds-of-wacky-number-formats)
      ; => #(0.7d0 19.0d0 70.0)
#+end_src

** TODO talk about accepting numbers like =.1= and =1.=, possibility of parsing into R-like factors from string-tables
